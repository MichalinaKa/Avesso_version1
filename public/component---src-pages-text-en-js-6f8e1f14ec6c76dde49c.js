Place is space permeated by memory, by crossings, the voices of those who opened the trails, “a portion of land / city / landscape seen from within”. To enter foreign territory requires temporality, the senses active and creating connections with what is still strange. Listening is radicalized in an attempt to absorb the recognizable sounds in the body-place that lives inside us. In the inner resonance of these voices, the possibility of speech germinates. Allocated in a nest-throat11, the words grow, take shape and take on a soul with the vibrating sound that protrudes from the mouth through the air. Being a foreigner in a algo-rithm place means wondering about the habitat, casting a suspicious look at what is unknown, unfamiliar.

It refers to the language practiced among farmers in a comparison with the act of plowing the land in stretches that, at the end of the land, turned and started over on a new line. It is said that in classical times, the Greeks wrote to the end of the line and then passed downwards, calling it a vertere, a verse. We can think that the Reversal of the inside-out reversal is a poem, a plowed field, a Möbius strip, "a topological surface where the end of one side restarts on the reverse of the other, which makes them indiscernible".

Gabriela Carvalho (Brazil, 1988) is usually a curator, writer (an artist?), producer, teacher, cook, dancer and, currently, she is developing a research project at FBAUP's PhD in Visual Arts program in the field of curatorial language. She begins from the notion of writing as one that inscribes something in time, that marks the ruins of history, to think about the catalytic dimension (from the Greek kata + logos) of curatorial practice. Under this logos, an endogenous deconstruction movement is launched in order to dismantle the phallogocentric axis of the exhibitions in a decolonializing perspective of the arts and, consequently, of curatorial practices.
